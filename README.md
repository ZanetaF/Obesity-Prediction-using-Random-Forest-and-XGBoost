## About This Project
This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on health and lifestyle data using Random Forest and XGBoost models. The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


## Project Details
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns, handle anomalies, and prepare the dataset for modeling.  
- Trained and fine-tuned Random Forest and XGBoost models using multiple hyperparameters and evaluated them with accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.  
- Analyzed feature importance to determine the most influential attributes for predicting obesity levels.
